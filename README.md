# Resume

Welcome to my Resume repository! This repository contains the source files for my professional resume, written in the LaTeX language. The objective of this repo is to showcase my skills and experiences, while also providing an easily customizable LaTeX template for others to use and modify.

## Repository Contents

- `resume.tex`: The main LaTeX source file for my resume.
- `resume.pdf`: A compiled PDF version of the resume for quick viewing.

## Prerequisites

To compile the resume, you'll need the following software installed on your machine:

1. LaTeX distribution (such as TeX Live, MacTeX, or MiKTeX)
2. A LaTeX editor (such as TeXstudio, TeXmaker, or Visual Studio Code with LaTeX Workshop)

## Compiling the Resume

To compile the resume, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/username/latex-resume.git`
2. Open the `resume.tex` file in your preferred LaTeX editor.
3. Build and compile the resume, which should generate a `resume.pdf` file.

## Customizing the Template

You can customize this LaTeX resume template to fit your needs by modifying the `resume.tex` file. Feel free to add or remove sections, adjust formatting, and change the color scheme to create your own unique resume.
